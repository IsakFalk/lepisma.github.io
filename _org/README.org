#+TITLE: Org babel-ish posts go here

Instead of moving completely to org for blog posts, idea here is to just do
basic transformations from ~org~ to ~md~ while keeping most of the markup powers in
the hands of jekyll plugins (since I have already spent time on making them
nice).

Posts here will be of notebookish nature with generated outputs, equations in
some form via ~org-babel~.
