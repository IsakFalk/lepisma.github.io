This is a personal wiki. Gradually, as I move files in here, it will take a more
hybrid wiki-blog form.

A list of all pages currently up here is in [[./allpages.org][all the pages]]. Here is a short run
down of those files:

- [[./emacs/][Emacs]] contains emacs and org-mode related things.
- [[./readings/index.org][Readings]] has some lists and reading resources.

Source code for this setup is [[https://github.com/lepisma/pile][here]]. My org-publish setup mostly lies [[https://github.com/lepisma/rogue/blob/master/local/rogue-pile/rogue-pile.el][here]]. If
you want an extensive guide on org based publishing setup, look [[https://thibaultmarin.github.io/blog/posts/2016-11-13-Personal_website_in_org.html][here]] and [[https://thibaultmarin.github.io/blog/posts/2017-08-15-Personal_wiki_in_org.html][here]].
