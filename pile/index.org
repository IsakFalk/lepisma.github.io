This is a personal wiki. Most of the pages here are still in transitory phase.
Gradually, as I move files in here, it will take a more hybrid wiki-blog form.

A list of all pages currently up here is in [[./allpages.org][all the pages]] [fn::Pages from my old
blog are [[https://lepisma.github.io/archive][here]].]. Org files from this wiki are [[https://github.com/lepisma/pile][here]]. Source code for managing
this wiki is mostly [[https://github.com/lepisma/rogue/blob/master/local/pile/][here]] but I might move it in a separate repository sometime.
