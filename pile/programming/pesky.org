From whatever I have experienced, there are two kind of mental models provided
by programming tools, /simple/ (e.g. [[http://dplyr.tidyverse.org/][dplyr]]) and /complex/ (e.g. [[https://pandas.pydata.org/][pandas]]). If used
sparingly, most powerful tools are really annoying unless, of course, you
clearly understand the idea behind the models they expose. Here are some tools
in that category which I would like to study very /thoroughly/ sometime:

1. Matplotlib. Maybe the recent updates made the API cleaner. A good resource to
   start might be [[http://www.labri.fr/perso/nrougier/teaching/matplotlib/matplotlib.html][this]].
2. $\LaTeX$ is like sand. Coarse, rough, irritating and gets everywhere. [[http://www.rpi.edu/dept/arc/docs/latex/latex-intro.pdf][Here]] is
   something that might help change my feelings.
3. [[https://sourceforge.net/projects/pgf/][TikZ]]. Inkscape has pretty weak scripting capabilities.
4. Regex. I specifically need to understand how it works to really appreciate
   it.
