Here is a thing about self help books. You might not agree with them completely
and/or they might not present solid backing for all they say, but they do help
by letting you think about ideas you could not have thought much about
otherwise.

This particular book is a neat example. I bet it is /like/ (in spite of the
presentation, which brought me to read it) other similar books in the genre.
That means it fits into my earlier paragraph's argument and I wouldn't /strongly/
recommend this specific book but would recommend reading/thinking about the
topics it touches.
