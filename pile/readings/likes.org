#+TITLE: Articles I like
#+SETUPFILE: ../assets/export.setup

I am not sure what kind of /liked/ articles I should keep a log of here (by using
the term /articles/, I am restricting myself to essays, blog posts and the likes).
Since this page lies in the general /reading/ section it is probably more suited
for general topics. As of now, I am keeping links which have assisted me in
framing my worldview and continue to assist me in elaborating the same to
others. I recently started logging these, so this list might be missing a lot of
what I would have meant to put here.
