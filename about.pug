              | I am an MS student in Computer Science at
              | <a href="https://www.cics.umass.edu/" target="_blank"> UMass
              | Amherst</a>. Earlier, I did bachelor coursework in Electrical
              | Engineering at <a href="http://www.iitr.ac.in" target="_blank">
              | Indian Institute of Technology, Roorkee </a>. I like learning
              | about and exploring patterns in natural and machine intelligence.

              | <a href="/archive">blog posts</a> or <a here="/pile"?>wiki</a>. Some of my
              | projects are on
              | <a href="{{ site.links.github }}" target="_blank">github</a>. I
              | live and travel a lot on the Internet. Physically, I am in my room
              | most of the time. Ideal way to get in touch would be to drop me an

                | I am broadly interested in the ways computational sciences help
                | explain physical and natural phenomena like intelligence and
                | life. At right levels of abstraction, I believe, all natural
                | processes can be reduced to a few common computational
                | <em>time evolution</em> operations. My ideal life state will let
                | me <em>have</em> and <em>spend</em> free time to study and play
                | with these ideas.
              p
                | I am equally fascinated by data and visualization based
                | exploration of complex systems. It is interesting how tiny
                | interactions can generate almost magical behavior.

                | github/lepisma</a>. A few explorations can be scrambled from my
                | <a href="/archive">blog</a>. I also maintain a list of incomplete
                | side (hobby) projects at <a href="https://lepisma.github.io/dev/">/dev</a>,
                | which gives me something when I am bored of my current work.
              p
                | I enjoy exploring and learning new languages and tools. Like
                | many others, I am in love with the
                | <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language)">Lisp family</a>
                | which makes programming <em>really</em> joyful. On the regular
                | side, I use Python, JS and Emacs (never ceases to

                | convinced me of the severity of problems they create and the
                | importance of being skeptical about them and making people aware
