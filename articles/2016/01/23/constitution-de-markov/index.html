<article class="post-content">
  <p><span class="dropcap">R</span>ecently I came across
<a href="https://www.constituteproject.org/">Constitute</a> project that provides <em>“the
World’s Constitutions to read, search, and compare”</em>. Now, 194 constitutions
have enough text to play around with generative text models. That is, to create
a model of text from the corpus and generate similar data from it.</p>

<p>Most of the impressive feats you will see around at present for generating text
use Recurrent Neural Networks. If you want to try these, use
<a href="https://github.com/karpathy/char-rnn">char-rnn</a> (lua) or
<a href="https://github.com/fchollet/keras/blob/master/examples/lstm_text_generation.py">lstm-text-generation-example</a>
of keras (python). There are many entertaining examples. Look around for
generated
<a href="https://medium.com/@samim/ted-rnn-machine-generated-ted-talks-3dd682b894c0#.z0dofjaea">TED talks</a>,
<a href="https://medium.com/@samim/obama-rnn-machine-generated-political-speeches-c8abd18a2ea0">Obama speeches</a>,
<a href="https://twitter.com/rnn_bible">Biblical tweets</a> etc. See Karpathy’s
<a href="http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/">post</a> for more
examples and insights.</p>

<p>Naturally, I tried doing the same with all the constitutions combined (a
universal constitution, all that power!). But, the amount of training time
required turned me off. So, I left RNNs for a simpler (faster) model, and wasn’t
disappointed.</p>

<h2 id="markov-chains">Markov Chains</h2>

<p>Lots and lots of parody text generators on the Internet use Markov Chains. They
provide probabilities of transition from one state (letter or word) to other
based on the statistics of data they are modeled on. The idea is really simple
and beautifully explained
<a href="http://setosa.io/blog/2014/07/26/markov-chains/">here</a>.</p>

<p>I will quickly jump to the fun part.</p>

<h2 id="wisdom">Wisdom</h2>

<p>I used markov model on dump of all the constitutional text combined. Here are
some of the pieces of wisdom generated.</p>

</blockquote>

<hr />

<p>If you want to play around with the data and/or script, head over to the
repository <a href="https://github.com/lepisma/fake-charter">here</a>. The script uses
<a href="http://rednoise.org/rita">RiTa</a> and runs on <em>node.js</em>. Try changing the N
factor (default 3) for creating different N-gram models. A higher value gives
similar to original results.</p>

<p>And remember</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Loss of citizenship starts at 11 a. m.</p>
