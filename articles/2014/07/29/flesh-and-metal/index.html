  <p><span class="dropcap">I</span>t isn’t long before we get to see
<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1340138/">another installment</a> of one of the
classic <em>cyborg</em> movies.
<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088247/">The Terminator (1984)</a> inspired many AI
junkies of our times (at least the people I know), specially because of sequels
surviving till the 2000s.</p>

<p>In the movie, a badass AI machine dubbed <em>Skynet</em> takes on humans after it
gains control over the technologies powering the world, including military and
communication systems. One of the hobbies of Skynet seemed to make <em>Cyborgs</em>
and send it back in time to kill the human leader who will lead the war against
machines.</p>

<p>So, does <em>“inspired by Skynet”</em> or even a similar human sound okay ?</p>

<p>From
<a href="http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/ten-inventions-inspired-by-science-fiction-128080674/?no-ist">Smithsonian Mag</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In 1914, H.G. Wells published a novel, The World Set Free, imagining the
emergence of “artificial” atomic energy by 1933, followed by a devastating
world war and the eventual emergence of a peaceful global government. Physicist
Leo Szilard read the book in 1932, which inspired him to solve the problem of
creating a nuclear chain reaction in 1933. The same book would inspire Szilard
to campaign for arms control and the peaceful, international use of nuclear
power after World War II.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Inspiration</strong> is not a positive word in science, neither is it negative, it is
neutral and like all other neutral words, it has both use cases. And its not
unethical to be inspired by a <em>villain</em> unless what you do of it is
<em>villainous</em>.</p>

<hr />

<p>Formally, a cyborg is</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>a fictional or hypothetical person whose physical abilities are extended
beyond normal human limitations by mechanical elements built into the body.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It seems to me, one of the goals of cyborg development is to make <strong>flesh</strong> and
<strong>metal</strong> interchangeable. Seeing the recent developments, this convergence is
bound to happen, at least partially.</p>

<p>There are many instances to strengthen the belief that in near future,
biological machines can be imitated using our traditional techniques, involving
computational unit and actuators.</p>

<p>Also the other way round, traditional machines will be using the goodness of
biological systems as is visible by this
<a href="http://news.illinois.edu/news/12/1115bio-bots_RashidBashir.html">bio-bots</a>
project. An explanatory video is
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skCzl7FlM34">here</a>.</p>

<hr />

<p>Let us take the most amazing sensory unit in any (relatively advanced)
biological machine, the <strong>vision</strong> unit.</p>

<p>From the classy <a href="http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/lenet/">LeNet</a>, demonstrating the
power of Convolutional Networks, to
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Brain">Google Brain</a> and further
<a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/news/features/dnnvision-071414.aspx">Adam</a>
by Microsoft, your instincts will make you believe that
<em><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/83518.The_Singularity_is_Near">the Singularity is Near</a></em>.</p>

<p>A noteworthy example here is of Jens Neumann, also referred sometimes as the
patient <strong>Alpha</strong>. Neumann lost his sight completely, but he got it partially
restored by one of the landmark <em>cyborgee</em> experiments involving a camera
<em>wired</em> to the visual cortex of brain (2002, about 12 years ago !). Although
this experience was brief for Neumann, but it must have been divine.</p>

<p>The researches in the field of Artificial Vision are important, and positive.
People are making attempts to understand the brain. Boundary between
<strong>Neuroscience</strong> and <strong>Artificial Intelligence</strong> is blurring.</p>

<p>But, the study of brain is not without issues.
Consider the <a href="https://backyardbrains.com/products/roboroach">Roboroach</a> project.
In this project, a <strong>Cockroach</strong> is stimulated via the antenna to move left or
right as commanded by an app.</p>

<p>To most of us, there is nothing bad here.
But here is a nice read.
The <strong>Ethics</strong>
<a href="http://wiki.backyardbrains.com/Ethical_Issues_Regarding_Using_Invertebrates_in_Education">statement</a>
by <strong>Backyard Brains</strong>, the group behind Roboroach. They are (at current stage)
mostly right from my personal point of views. But the page is a must read to
understand what issues are present when experimenters try to test things on
biological organisms.</p>

<p>And there is no dearth of such examples</p>

<ul>
  <li>Remote controlled beetles by DARPA</li>
  <li>Remote controlled rats</li>
  <li>Remote controlled pigeons</li>
  <li>. . .</li>
</ul>

<p>A more complete reference is in the wikipedia article about
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_control_animal">Remote control animals</a></p>

<p>Experiments on animals have a scary potential to be extended for humans,
specially in a world already filled with cruel experimentation examples. I will
list few of the most infamous examples (not in any order, there is no order for
such things), with Wikipedia links to read and follow the necessary redirects.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_human_experimentation">Nazi human experimentation</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_731">Unit 731</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuskegee_syphilis_experiment">Tuskegee syphilis experiment</a></li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>Many believe that there is a Skynet in the making. When
<a href="http://www.robotictechnologyinc.com/index.php/home">Robotic Technology Inc</a>
said that their robot, the
<a href="http://www.robotictechnologyinc.com/index.php/EATR">EATR</a>, is vegetarian,
people were skeptical. When Google acquired 8 robotics companies in 6 months,
people were skeptical. But wait ! When recently, the Roboroach guys experimented
with wired Scorpions, here is what I
<a href="http://www.popularmechanics.com/science/health/nueroscience/the-robo-scorpion-is-coming-and-no-one-is-safe-17035113?click=pm_latest">got</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“The Robo-Scorpion is Coming and <strong>No One is Safe</strong>”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Without digging specifically here, I believe there are loopholes in science
journalism. When I was in school, I heard more people talking about a black hole
that will gulp down the whole Earth, if the
<strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_Hadron_Collider">LHC</a></strong> is made to run.
And only one or two guys actually knew the meaning of <em>Boson</em> (hoping that they
might have come across <em>Higgs Boson</em> in the news articles) !</p>

<p>Some might say that they are not wrong, the journalists, the kids, the common
people. Its just the <em>essential</em> premonition about the future technologies
surfacing. Deep inside, humans are somewhat attracted towards war, towards
things that explode, towards movies about destruction. Maybe this is the result
of the leftovers in our genes from our ancestors, for whom war had an important
survival value.</p>

<p>I believe that many times the fault is in the interpretations. There are, and
will always be people who use technology for <em>Bad Science</em>. But, there are
people who work for the love for science and technology, and even if their
theories are not for the direct (positive) use by humans or other organisms,
their intent is.</p>

<p>Maybe I haven’t seen much to say this, but journalism, being a very powerful
tool, is used very much wrongly at places.</p>

<hr />

<p>A.C. Clarke said it rightly</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“It has yet to be proven that intelligence has any survival value.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Intelligence wont take you long, understanding will.
Until the people are right by heart, there is nothing wrong with cyborgs.</p>
