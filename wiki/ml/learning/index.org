#+TITLE: Breaking down /Learning/
#+SETUPFILE: ../../../assets/export.setup

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
This page is a work in progress. Most likely, the ideas here are already out
there in some form. After an initial dump, my attempt here would be to merge it
with other works and make this a live document about the steps involved in
learning.

* TODO Items
- Mechanistic models + cloud
- do-calculus
- typed lambda calculus
- Idea of representation. To move beyond simple associative learning, we need a
  representation capable of having a interpretation itself.
- Undirected weighted graphs as experience encoder and type systems as domain
  specific decoders.

- Theoretical impediments... Pearl (2018)
- Intelligence without representation, Rodney A Brooks
