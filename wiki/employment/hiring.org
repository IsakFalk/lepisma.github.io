#+TITLE: Hiring
#+SETUPFILE: ../../assets/export.setup

Not nearly enough but I have been involved in a few hirings directly or
indirectly. And I have been wrong about many things. In this page I will try to
dump my thoughts regarding a few involved topics and iteratively improve my
process in case I need to do something similar again.

* Communication

* Subjectivity

* Structure

* Reason

* TODO Mass

- Replying to candidates
- Subjectivity
  - complement of resume
  - process of improvement
- A more structured approach
  - Resources vs candidates etc.
- Reasoning rejection
  - even if you are fair
  - bias and question level
- Accepting the mass process of applications
- Dry run your process on someone before implementing
