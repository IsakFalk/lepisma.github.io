Notes from [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/460984.On_Growth_and_Form][On Growth and Form]]. This piece is /so/ enticing to read. Though I wish
there were translations for the many Latin, French quotes scattered liberally in
the book.

Here I have kept interesting observations, ideas and insights from the book
separated in chapters and sections. I am following [[https://www.amazon.in/gp/product/0486671356/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o07_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1][this version]].

The /things/ which we see in the cell are less important than the /actions/ which we
recognise in the cell..

There is a nice description of the process of cell division here. Not sure about
the exactness of the understanding as per our current knowledge, but the way the
idea was conveyed using abstractions of forces is beautiful. A point to note is
that:

#+begin_quote
... it is not our purpose to /assert/ that some one particular mode of action is
at work, but merely to shew that there do exist physical forces, or
distributions of force, which are capable of producing the required result ...

A piece that I find interesting is of /Hydrodynamic magnetism/ wherein particles
in a fluid which are oscillating or pulsating create attractive and repulsive
fields in the fluid similar to regular magnets. The general idea of /permeability/
applies here and particles are attracted or repelled depending on their
permeability with respect to the surrounding fluids.

I am not able to figure out the right sets of words to see what this phenomenon
is known as at the present.
