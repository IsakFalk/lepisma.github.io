Notes from [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/460984.On_Growth_and_Form][On Growth and Form]]. This piece is /so/ enticing to read. Though I wish
there were translations for the many Latin, French quotes scattered liberally in
the book.

Here I have kept interesting observations, ideas and insights from the book
separated in chapters and sections. I am following [[https://www.amazon.in/gp/product/0486671356/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o07_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1][this version]].
