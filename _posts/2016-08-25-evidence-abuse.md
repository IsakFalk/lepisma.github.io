<span class="dropcap">W</span>eird things happen when you are at home. You get
to talk to *real* people and get out of your utopic daydream. I have recently
been unable to argue with people on a few topics. I wonder if I am getting too
old for this shit. Most of these happen when I touch a *gray* portion of
certain communicated opinions. It gets hard to convince people about a general
sense of blackness or whiteness. In every argument, you can easily weasel out
solid points for your favour. And if people have even a single point in favour,
they are willing to stick it with their sense of identity and refuse to accept
any change. (I need an ego deflation session, mail me)

Some cases are easy to argue against. You just roll your eyes. Some are
not-so-easy. Let me give a general sense of what type of content I am talking
about. Consider vegetarian and non-vegetarian eating habits. Simplest of the
arguments will split opinions among factions. The neutrals are easy to get
baptized to either side. Only when you give enough time, the fog begins to clear.
Till then, the arguments go on like meteor showers. Never hitting anything. Its
not necessary that one side is ultimately right and other is wrong. But there
is something special about the ways bad arguments work here, which makes it
easy to know who is putting real arguments and who is shuffling flip-flops.
Meanwhile the flip-flop guy isn't aware of things and has trust on the points of
virtue of his / her cause. This makes it hard. *"Hey you are being good, but its
not the right way"*, ever heard this work?

Things boil down to poor journalism and communication. Information communication
is how you learn about things and use them to make arguments. Poor examples of
communication almost always mishandle evidence. I will mention 3 major cases
here that I repeatedly face.

Before I begin, I want to specifically focus on the point that the topic of my
interest in all these cases, for this post, is the *presentation of information*
and not the information itself. This post might also look like doing undue
exaggeration of the issue, I will try to convince you its not the case. Also, I
am no expert on many things and have been involved in stupidity pretty much
regularly. So don't take things here as absolute truths, but opinions of sort.

One of my relative forwarded the following message to me.

<blockquote>
<p>
"The Fact of Melatonin*
<br>
Plz make it a point to sleep early... ðŸ˜´ðŸ˜Š
<br>
Thats how God has made us... Sleep at night and work during the day...â˜º Today I
learnt something new... A natural cancer vaccine.
<br>
God placed in each and everyone of us a gland in our head called the Pineal
gland. It is considered to be the biological clock of the human body and it is
also connected to the sight nerve. It is small like the size of a pea. Everyday
after sundown this gland starts producing a substance called Melatonin which
runs in the bloodstream and protects the body from cancer. ðŸ˜‹
<br>
This gland works only in the dark so if the eye is exposed to light the gland
does not work because it thinks night has not come yet...ðŸ¤” So if you stay up at
night in the light, you are depriving your body from this daily vaccine...
<br>
Our parents and grandparents who used to sleep early in the night and wake up
early in the morning did not suffer from cancer or any of the disease we hear
about today.
<br>
God has placed this daily vaccine in our body to protect us so let's put it to
use by sleeping early.ðŸ’ª
<br>
The gland starts working from after dark until two hours before sunrise !!!ðŸŒž
<br>
Must read and share this miraculous physiology God designed inside man... ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š"
</p>
</blockquote>

Is there anything wrong here? If you are careful, you might find a few mistakes.
But someone sent you this with good intentions. Honestly, I am happy someone
other than my parents (ok, the sender was not one of my parents) give a damn
about when I put my head on pillow. And this message has no side effects and
isn't really wrong, isn't it?

I know you have started hating me already. Anyways, what drives you to believe a
thing like this? Scientific evidence, right? Right?

You might have heard of melatonin if you use some screen filter like
[flux](https://justgetflux.com), [redshift](http://jonls.dk/redshift/),
[red-moon](https://github.com/raatmarien/red-moon) etc. for filtering out
blueish lights in night. Melatonin gets released in darkness, has things with
sleep wake cycle and certain results find blue side of the spectrum affecting
its release. A well informed source for reading on the topic is
[this](http://skeptics.stackexchange.com/a/30730) answer. Notice how the
researches talk about statistical significance and uncertainties.

What about cancer? Wikipedia usually does a good job for communicating popular
knowledge and opinions. By design it can be rigged by one side of a research. But,
when it notes a contradiction among results, you can be assured to find multiple
arguments floating around among researchers. Head over to the
Wikipedia article on
[melatonin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melatonin#Cancer). First, there is not
much consensus. A bit of web search will tell you that there are few researches
supporting its assistance in certain forms of cancer (mostly breast cancer).
But in any case, the results never state it as a *'vaccine for cancer'*. Go on.
Mail me papers. Convince me. At least an *in-vivo* trial that concludes it as a
cure for cancer. Even, many of the quacks (I know a few) use 'maybe' when
talking melatonin and cancer connection, because otherwise whats stopping them
from solving the whole world's cancer with a
[cheap, over-the-counter medicine](https://duckduckgo.com/?t=lm&q=buy+melatonin+online)?

Oh, and you can also find pretty damn sure articles that say its a miraculous
thing against cancer. We will talk about those cases in section 2.

How do you communicate a research which is not strongly established? Obviously
you factor in the risk and play it safe by saying that *"thing X might lead to
cancer"*. *Might*, because scientists are not sure. *Might*, because the
explosive mutability of information can't be controlled. *Might*, because you
really understand the uncertainties and are willing to go an extra mile to
shackle the chains around us. But we say

> "Hey kiddo! We simplify things so people get it, get it?"

#### Simplification.

<figure>
<a href="https://xkcd.com/547/">
<img src="/images/posts/evidence/simple.png">
</a>
<figcaption><a href="https://xkcd.com/547/">xkcd - 547</a></figcaption>
</figure>

No one can know everything. So we use a few tricks. We learn how to utilize
sources and do reasoning. In fact this is what we are taught in schools.
Everything else, you learn on the go. We work on coarse models of the world when
we can't understand or afford a finer one.

The model we use are made of bricks of a certain kind of framework that you
choose to be true. Like science, religion, morality etc. The model itself tries
to faithfully represent the observed behaviour of a certain system. For a
particular system, many models work, irrespective of the backing framework or
observational errors.

Consider climate change. Established observations
[say](http://climate.nasa.gov/vital-signs/global-temperature/) that the
temperature is increasing globally over the years. Say we have to understand and
communicate this observation to the masses. We start by creating a model that
explains the observation. Now the analysts choose their weapon of choice and
create models with various levels of abstractions. Some go with hard atmospheric
sciences, some believe we are in a simulation and go with that, some work using
human morality and some with religion.

Next, onto communication. Most of the frameworks have certain techniques to
abstract away their finest models so as to reach a wider audience. A common
method is used by religions in many practical cases which reduces their model
abstractions to simple human morality. When a writer tries to tell people about
a system, he / she uses a model which is approachable by the *target audience*.

- An airplane flies using its *'certain kind'* of wings. Want more?
- The wings when *'pushed forward'* create a *'situation'* in air around it, that
  makes it go up. Want more?
- The wings are shaped in *'such a way'* that the air speed above and below it are
  different and *'an established theory'* explains the observed lift. Want more?
- ...
- Here is the actual documentation with mechanisms and *'assumptions'*.

Notice the quoted words. You can't abstract away models without allowing
uncertainties, its a myth loved by most of the promoters of ancient-wisdom and
preachers that I know of. If you are able to, you model was fat and bloated. A
good communication lets you know at what level of abstraction you are reading
and how to shift up gears if you can afford it. More importantly, it makes you
able to ask the right sort of questions.

Another kind of uncertainty comes with the research itself. Digging deeper makes
you see that there are many models, within a framework, competing to explain
observations using certain sub-frameworks. The original model creator warns you
about these. The assumptions are laid bare and the competing ideas are visible
to naked eyes. The person responsible for popularizing the model passes these
on faithfully to a higher abstraction level. The results are not statistically
significant? No issue. *"Mate, the scientists tried to compare this. The results
are slightly negative but more inconclusive. Though its nice to be safe"*.

Whenever you see an absolute truth walking down, descending from
heaven itself to grace the internet with its aura, you got a task at hand. Fish
out for uncertainties. You know they are there, they can't hide if not for
assumptions (in which case, the assumptions can't hide). Simplification doesn't
take away uncertainties, but tries to save them.

The content I mentioned in the beginning seems to have an idiosyncratic way of
simplification. Similar contents can be seen in their natural habitat of quick
witted media. IM forwards, social networking posts, micro blogs etc. I remember
this line from
[Fahrenheit 451](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17470674-fahrenheit-451)
talking about things that the characters were missing in the fiction

<blockquote>
<p>
Number one, as I said, quality of information. Number two: leisure to digest it.
[...]
</p>
<footer>
<cite title="Fahrenheit 451">Faber - Fahrenheit 451</cite>
</footer>
</blockquote>

Leisure to digest comes with a responsibility of **not** using the leisure to start
devouring another piece of information or throwing paper planes out of windows.

The message I mentioned has following *non-factoid* issues that hurt me (sorry
sender), despite my respect for the concern of the sender:

1. **Swapping of model back end**: A model must be passed on as it was created. We
   can't mix and match things to suite the prejudices of audience or ourselves.
   Like in this case, some non-creationist atheist (like me) can get pissed off
   and avoid reading the content altogether.
   
2. **Term abuse, Vaccine**: I remember a guy in train preaching people (college
   juniors) that Newton's law of gravitation is wrong and you can't use that.
   Apparently, someone didn't use the right set of words while explaining him
   the idea that theories have certain limits, assumptions and validity over
   scale. And Newton's law is not really adequate for some specific needs.
   
3. **Misinterpretation of data**: Dying at 30 from T.B. saves
   us from common old age death causes. Cancer too, yes.
   
4. **Absolute facts**: I can believe this message lies on the side where researchers
   are certain about cancer effect, but then the reader should get hints for the
   general disagreement, which is pretty much known (specially for the original
   content creator).

#### Evidence

<figure>
<a href="https://xkcd.com/925/">
<img src="/images/posts/evidence/cell_phones.png">
</a>
<figcaption><a href="https://xkcd.com/925/">xkcd - 925</a></figcaption>
</figure>

Evidence keeps wild information mutations in check. Its not so much about
actually putting up the citations before passing the message. Citations can also
be successfully abstracted. More important is to ensure that there is no drought of
evidence. Ensure that there are sufficient amount of them before passing on
information, or creating a higher level abstraction. And ensure that the receiver
bears the same comfort and responsibility with evidence.

Evidence, not to be confused with observations, ties the whole model building
process together. Absence of evidence allows you to do mix and match, exaggerations,
misinterpretations and misjudgments.

I mean, what would have been wrong if the message would be circulating without
the issues we talked about. Heeding to evidence would have kept the facts in
check (like whether Pineal gland or
[SCN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suprachiasmatic_nucleus) is known as the
'clock'), would have included the required uncertainty of results, and even then
could have made the point it originally intended (making me sleep earlier). How
many people are now convinced that there is such a thing like *'vaccine'* for
cancer? How many people are assured enough to not look upon *'Melatonin'* on even
Wikipedia since the information provided is complete and absolute? How many
irrational nostalgic sentiments about healthy life of yesterdays have been
fueled again? How many people have been convinced that every move we make, is
against the grand scheme of someone's God? In my personal experiences with
people, I can safely say, A Hell Lot!

I was recently involved in a facebook discussion about effects of microwave on
food items. The issues included bad effects of microwave on food and carcinogenic
quality of plastic + microwave interaction. Without touching the topic, let me
tell you the state of the final facebook post. There are around 20 citations
floating around. Many of which are not going to affect the arguments. Sadly, the
original link shared was enough to convince most of us that its good science.
Citations, references, geeky words, what else do you need? I am sure not more
than 5 (not sure about the number) guys actually went through, or needed to look
at the citations. Also, I can assure you, many adventurous people who opened the
main link came out convinced that they were dealing with science. To put it
straight, many of us believe that there is no such thing as poor science.

Let John Oliver [explain](https://youtu.be/0Rnq1NpHdmw) you what kind of
cases I am talking about.

<div class="video-wrapper">

<br>

Its different from the first situation. You ask for evidence and the first guy
will realize the lack and would go on the defensive. This case will throw
so many of them, however shallow, you will get almost convinced of the argument
because you can't gather enough time to accept / refute them. The evidence
feels so solid on the surface, your mind will be confused whether they are
actually refutable if I do a web search with my *'limited'* knowledge. Finally you
succumb to *"better be safe than sorry"*.

You can almost feel the shades of gray here. Promotion of science in the way
science intends is great, right? Look at all the T.V. programs, all the news
articles, everything is helping people to accept science in their daily lives. Look
again, and you can see an almost exuberant insincerity for evidence spilling
from the mouths of promoters. Of course not all of them.

#### Pseudo Science

Take that microwave oven case. Here is the
[link](http://www.medicaldaily.com/microwaves-are-bad-you-5-reasons-why-microwave-oven-cooking-harming-your-health-250145)
that was shared. If you actually read that link, you might have already reached
[this article](http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2010/05/18/microwave-hazards.aspx).
See how the content itself is similar to the melatonin message, but the
presentation is different. Obviously, this link will also
get to its level of WhatsApp forward, but its all pro-science in the article. This
one is trying hard to stand on the shoulders of giants. Evidence, references,
articles, numbers, bio-photons? food value? bio-information from sun? Microwave
ban in Russia? dioxins? Most of the times, these get convincing because of the
jargons, our fear to look beyond them and cherry picked exaggerations from
quacks.

Go to some skeptic forums, they have good sources of information to read from
and they welcome heavy skepticism. Go to
[RationalWiki](http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Microwave_oven), search
[/r/skeptic](https://www.reddit.com/r/skeptic/search?q=microwave&restrict_sr=on&sort=relevance&t=all)
and
[/r/DebunkThis](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebunkThis/search?q=microwave&restrict_sr=on&sort=relevance&t=all)
(I have linked microwave specific results),
follow whatever points you can find against any argument. This is important, not
because I am convincing you to go against the original argument, but because in
cases with a deluge of superficial evidence, you will most like fail to notice
the *'taken out-of-context'* information, which you can learn only when you hear the
counter arguments. Hell! I don't even want to link so many articles debunking
this. It would be sad. And ironic. You might say well, how do you know which
links are right, which links are wrong? I don't. You can never accept any
content just as it is. But, you can have a prior belief about certain kind of
content which makes you focus your skepticism where its most needed. Go on, read
all the links you find. I am assured, after a while you can tell whether an
article has a higher chance of pseudo-science just by looking at its CSS. Its like
finding your perfect life partner. A beautiful breeze will touch you and put a
smile on your face (No kidding!).

Pseudo science tries hard to look like real science. Uses all the tools used by
science. It tries to convince people using something it doesn't understand. Just
a pinch of skepticism and the house of cards is destroyed.

Consider homeopathy. Something that's still pretty much established because people
didn't try, or weren't able to go through the 'science' thrown at them.
In case you are missing out, please read the
[basic principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeopathic_dilutions) of
homeopathy. Same case. Many of us claim its the real thing, without actually
knowing how and why, just because we were somehow 'convinced' of its
sciency-ness.

Citations are not badges of authenticity, they are tools of abstraction
outsourcing. And when they are not helping in abstraction, there is no 'other'
use you can conjure out of thin air for them.

A few people who are good at conjuring the 'other' uses are:

1. **Quacks**: Promoting their method of treatment, wellness etc. *The doctors*
2. **Simple innocent beings**: Afraid, distressed by the hammer of 'science'.
   *The patients*
3. **Wannabe scientists**: Don't care much about the real thing if it serves the
   public image and the inner scientist. *Vectors of disease*

The only people who are willing to listen fall in type 2. And they need access
to real consolidated evidence. A truckload of evidence is used most of the time
when you are not sure about whether any of them is right (independent of whether
the thing is actually right or wrong). A gross misinterpretation of scientific
method and communication.

Consider the sources you are getting your information from. The sources which
support one pseudo-science are, by design, going to support other
pseudo-sciences if they feel like. See if you can find meaningless diversions
and misinterpretation of the evidence. Real bold scientific claims don't come
in a *Buzzfeed* list. They don't devoid you of your ability to reach the
original research. They welcome it. Their basic hypothesis is clear and
analyzable. And they don't mix inconsistent web sources to create a coherent
model of their liking.

Of course, there are issues when you attack these sources. I already mentioned
the grayness of these arguments. You will definitely be able to find patches of
truth in the information provided and will wonder why I am being so diligent
with my attacks. I don't need theories with doubtful validity claiming *"17 life
energies from sun that gives you food"* to convince me of Sun's role. Just a
simple reminder of photosynthesis will do.

## 3. Disregard

<center>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Colgate
used to warn against Indian traditional ways of using salt &amp; coal on teeth.

Explore the tweet above (basically the linked image). Come back later. Look,
what arguments can be put here to favour both sides. Colgate told not to rub
abrasives on your teeth. Later they tried incorporating
[activated charcoal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activated_carbon) in their
products in a form *they* found better. On the other side, baba tells us about
this hypocrisy that companies regularly employ to sell stuff. Obviously, both
arguments are good and bad in different ways.

Anyways, I see this message promoting two things

1. There is a reason higher than scientific method to decide against or in favor
   of a product. In this case, ethnocentrism, nationalism and other
   similar ideas on different scales.
   
2. You shouldn't feel a need to question anything if you are supportive of point
   1.

You could argue that its just an example of healthy rivalry. But, do you see
this message driving people to go for the real knowledge about what should they use
for cleaning teeth, and in which form (*buy our toothpastes*)? I don't see it.
Maybe you could pry it out if someone is willing to reveal it. But do you think
people care when they are *attacked* by foreign companies and are *loosing*
their tradition?

Now, Baba gave us cool exercises. Great. Cheaper products don't hurt me. Neither
do I get a heart stroke when one company gives competition to other
established players. But on what cost to the popular thinking? I have seen
people actually getting conscious about health and that's cool. But no one can
amputate my head as if I don't give a damn about who controls my thoughts and
stories. I live in a country that has *earned* its independence and I know what
emotions you can stir when you invoke nationalistic ideas. Talk about eternal
cultural superiority, shout national slogans, appeal to ancient science and you
get an army of martyrs without cause, ready to sabotage the people who ask "why".

The questions people need answers to are innocent. They aren't against anything,
as presumed by the preachers. They are just questions. But the techniques of
preachers doesn't have anything but disregard for them. You don't need to talk
about evidence, because they are talking much above these petty issues.

Advertisements do this all the time. They look for what sells and target
advertisements that way. There are pockets of worshippers built around products
and logo badges. By design and diversity, usually these pockets keep things
chaotic (though I accept there is a certain drift over time). But I am yet to
hear a person asking me to buy a certain biscuit by a certain company because of
a reason other than what the ingredients label yell or certain offers indicate.
Sure there is congenital imbecility to account for, but I have strong reasons to
believe that I can at least reason around with them.

I mean, I would just say

> "Hey, you ain't gaining nothing by buying truckload of
> this biscuit that comes with x amount of mobile recharge, cause you are an
> amnesiac moron who doesn't remember when was the last time you **enjoyed** its
> taste."

This works in theory and, most of the time, in practice. Let me tell you
why. Because you didn't sell your soul to a certain school of thought with
weird set of priorities. Because your product decisions don't tie to and create your
identity. Because a demagogue can't yell a battle cry, right or wrong, and take
control of your life decisions.

#### Cults

I have absolutely no problem with product promotion based on actual quality.
But, we know a few entities that tend to differ here. I saw a roadside banner
for some mobile company InFocus that said something like *"Why buy Chinese, when
you can get American?"* (I read this on billboards in Varanasi and Lucknow,
can't seem to find it on internet. So, can't assure if it was put by the company
or some local store. In case you have read it too, please send me a pic for
inclusion). Is this a good reason? Since I am not touching anything sensitive,
we can get neutral and reasonable answers for this particular advertisement. Its
no. You can have certain tendencies, but you don't make decisions using them.

The models we talked about, there can be many kinds that work. There are many
lapses in almost all the backing frameworks. Some accept the lapses, make way
for other models to move in action. *Morality* and *Science* complement each other
real good this way. Some don't. And mainly the ones with most number of
deficiencies in term of framework capabilities. These framework claim to be
absolutely complete and purer than anything other. Complete. Right from their
inception to the present time, despite the popular knowledge that they visibly
mutate by piggybacking on badges of modern scientific developments (like quantum
physics, mail me if you want to know the secrets of the universe; I wonder what
would have happened if they had to popularize their ideas before 1920s).

Cults like these feed on your personal prejudices. You might be a properly
functioning person, but when it comes to your cult, you share common, group
beliefs and it gets hard to listen to a voice of reason. The leaders are
charismatic. You might not see them doing anything bad, but it doesn't work
out in practice. They patch your ignorance with some mumbo-jumbo and you feel
devoid of vulnerabilities. Pure. Complete. All knowing sentient entity free from
restraints. Floating in an eternal universe of bliss. Remember,

No one's wisdom is gonna bring salvation to you but yours. Your information
source should give you freedom to exercise your freedom. I remember a student
talking in my undergraduate university mess to someone that our ancient wisdom
tells to not sleep with your head pointing north pole (a myth promoted by *some*
alternate med guys and traditionalists). Whats the issue? He is killing the
spirit of evidence by choosing a framework that disregards them. Also he is
hurting himself by choosing a B.Tech. in Electrical Engineering while apparently
having spent the time sleeping when someone was teaching about magnetic dipoles
in high school.

The point is, if something tends to make you disregard the evidence by putting
on a faith-face or shoving your own moral fragility deep inside you, you say

> Aye, I got this covered! I am the king of xenophobes, but balance my biases

Call me paranoid with [SIWOTI syndrome](https://xkcd.com/386/). I am over
touching everything. Maybe I live among jerks and am butthurt. Maybe I just have
a dystopian fetish. This post shouldn't have been this long. In fact this could
have been a much gentler tea-time conversation just like we regularly have on
climate change, vaccination, GMO etc. Ah! the wonderful evenings. But I am fed
up talking with people who just want to drink tea. Look around yourself, throw
pebbles in water. See what floats, what sinks. Try to foresee the long term
effects if circulations like these keep on going unrestrained by a few who give
a damn. Sure, you can argue that there is nothing presently 'that' harmful done
by these issues (though I disagree). But, boy! You will be sorry then because no
one will be able to question the conspiracy of silence when it hits you.

First, look for evidence and the acceptance it receives in the content you got.
Second, see if the 'science' overwhelms you to a point where you risk accepting it as
granted. Third, check if somebody is sneaking a leash over how you are going to
analyze contents.

More than abuses to evidence, these are abuses to our sanity
and intellect as a population. Even if melatonin saves you from cancer, even if
microwave oven gives you cancer or even if the cult fictions are the ultimate
facts, the point stays. Final verdict can't be used to prove the righteousness
of fickle arguments.

- This leads to that.
- Scientists[1] say, this leads[2] to[3] that[4]. References.
- This, because [*insert your cult leader's wet dream*]

Ask yourself, if these contents pass through you unchecked, will you be able to
shed the guilt of depriving kids of genuine 'curiosity'? Guilt of fooling people
into believing they are 'scientists'? Guilt of closing your eyes to the truth

maybe its all meaningless and you already are in a cult with mechanisms for
redemption in place.
