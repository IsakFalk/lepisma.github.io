title: Choosing your Research Manager
summary: Review of popular free reference management tools.
category: articles
---

<span class="dropcap">I</span>n the beginning you will save PDFs in a folder,
rename them properly, google for papers and make bibliography files manually. It
all works, until it doesn't.

My first exposure to reference management was with
[Readcube](http://readcube.com). I mostly used it for reading. Its side effect
was, *enchanted* workflow and organization of the `/papers` directory. Making
the perfect abstraction. Clutter no more. After using few more tools, I thought
to make a comparison table according to my needs.

## Showdown

Few general guidelines and clarifications for interpreting the comparison given
here:

- This list is not exhaustive (obviously) and only includes few **free** dektop
  softwares. Although [Endnote](http://endnote.com),
  [Papers](http://www.papersapp.com) etc. offer free trials, I don't feel like
  comparing them, since 1 or 2 months aren't useful unless you actually buy the
  thing.

- Everyone has a reason to switch to a reference manager. They are different for
  different people. Here, the parameters for comparison are based on my own
  needs and are arranged in order of decreasing priority. For the sake of
  completeness, following are few important parameters missing from this
  comparison:
  - Groups and collab support
  - Editor support. Word, OpenOffice etc.

 . | . | Mendeley | Zotero | Qiqqa | Readcube | Colwiz
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---
1 | Export/Import | ★★★★★ | ★★★★☆ | ★★★★☆ | ★★★☆☆ | ★★★★★
2 | PDF handling | ★★★★☆ | ★★☆☆☆ | ★★★★★ | ★★★★☆ | ★★★☆☆
3 | Publication search and import | ★★★★☆ | ★★★☆☆ | ★★☆☆☆ | ★★★☆☆ | ★★★★★
4 | User Interface | ★★★★☆ | ★★★☆☆ | ★★★☆☆ | ★★★★★ | ★★★★☆
5 | Cloud and sync | ★★★★★ | ★★★☆☆ | ★★★☆☆ | ★★★☆☆ | ★★★★★

**Export/Import** ratings are based mostly on BibTeX support and clipboard ease.

**Publication search** ratings are based on the support for online databases
(in-app search) and ways of importing references (browser extensions and/or
in-app import).

**Cloud and sync** ratings are based on the web interface, space provided and
sync capabilities.

### Remarks

- For hardcore reference management, Mendeley is a powerhouse, no doubt. But,
  you can't grab pdfs while searching from Mendeley desktop ! **Bummer** ! Isn't
  it? Though, its the only bummer.

- Zotero doesn't have internal PDF reader, so no thing as such (since I am left
  with chrome). In fact, Zotero Standalone (desktop version) doesn't feel much
  without the browser extension. [Zotfile](https://github.com/jlegewie/zotfile)
  addon improves few things with PDFs, but doesn't fix everything. Plus the
  cloud storage is 300 MB only.

- Qiqqa will surprise you. The UI is pretty basic (feels retro, actually) and
  has no gimmicks. But, the overall PDF handling, including annotation,
  searching, OCR etc., is *really*, ***really*** powerful. Online search is
  awkward, it uses an internal web browser for that, which doesn't feel
  intuitive.

- For basic, no-nonsense reading needs, Readcube and Colwiz are awesome. They
  have nice UIs and straightforward reference management. Specially Colwiz, with
  better search and import support, is a great general purpose reading tool.

Now, if you bring other features (that **you** might need) in consideration, the
equations will change. Mendeley and Zotero have tonnes of advanced features, it
all depends on what you need, you might want light reference management with
more reading/discovery, or hardcore reference management.

For me, a combination of Mendeley and Colwiz/Readcube works fine. Feel free to
try others though.
