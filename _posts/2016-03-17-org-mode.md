title: M-x org-mode
summary: On why you too should give Emacs Org-mode a spin
category: articles

<span class="dropcap">J</span>ust came across a hackernews
[post](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11296843) on
[Org-mode](http://orgmode.org/). Its beautiful to know people settling into
various states of equilibrium with Org for different needs. The first time I
used Org was for simple note taking purpose. But left it in no time since
Emacs was a whole new (and weird) thing for a newbie like me.

Disappointed from [all](http://www.any.do/) [the](https://workflowy.com/)
[flashy](https://www.wunderlist.com/) [kids](https://evernote.com/) due to one
reason or another (mostly lack of satisfaction; don't know why), I switched to
keeping notes on a local dropbox folder. Then, gave Org another shot.

Initially, there were just three things I needed Org to help me with

- Note taking
- Planning tasks
- Some kind of cloud sync

This time, I kept track of the possibilities and started discovering teeny-tiny
bits of happiness. Things like table completion, tags, marking todo/done etc.
Starting with simple, hierarchical notes, I slowly moved to marking and tagging
items. Then started to use agenda (I was late). Agenda view lets you see your
schedule and timed tasks from calendar entries in Org files.

Fast forward a few weeks, I have my college time table, birthday lists,
meetings, class notes, few other (encrypted) things, everything in Org files.
And I have never faced any form of friction with my lists since then.

Right now, I use [spacemacs](http://spacemacs.org/) for my Emacs configuration.
Its easier to setup packages in spacemacs, due to modular structures called
layers (see a list of
[available layers](https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs/blob/master/layers/LAYERS.org)),
which can be enabled/disabled in your personal configuration (along with some
variable passing). Spacemacs is also useful for vim users shifting to Emacs. In
fact it was made to merge both the editors. Anyways, there is an Org layer
already present in spacemacs repo. If you are like me and keep many plain text
files in a directory, [deft](http://jblevins.org/projects/deft/) can come in
handy. Just point your `deft-directory` variable `(setq deft-directory
"~/Dropbox/notes")` to notes directory and you can have a *really* fast file
filter.

Deft is also available as a layer in spacemacs. Spacemacs is well documented and
a peek at its
[README](https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs/blob/master/README.md) should get
you started, in case you are planning to try it.

Need encryption ? Save the file as `name.org.gpg` and Emacs will use
symmetric/asymmetric encryption to access and write to the file. This is
specially useful for a synced folder on a cloud storage service like dropbox.

Plug in [org-alert](https://github.com/groksteve/org-alert) to create reminders.
Enable flyspell (spell check) for a full fledged writing mode. Or just write
your own module for your needs (like for inserting clipboard images).

## Export everywhere

Exporting support from Org is amazingly complete (add
[pandoc](http://pandoc.org/) for extra frills) and probably adds the most to
general purpose use scenarios. Put in your plans, write down notes and then
export to any format. Present using
[revealjs](https://github.com/yjwen/org-reveal/), plain latex beamers or inside
Emacs itself.

If you need to share notes of some sort, or just want to write a well formed
$$\LaTeX$$ pdf, well, just export to $$\LaTeX$$ pdf (with tables, images, links
etc.).

These are few of the endless feats possible and you can never know enough to get
bored or *saturated*. Since its easier to work with Org files in Emacs, due to
the (obviously) tight integration, you can safely leave any popular markup
language like markdown or rst (just if you need: github shows formatted `.org`
files). Worst case ? Do an `org-export`.

Although its useful when you are actually *using* Emacs as your main text
editor, I believe trying emacs just for Org is an experience you will never
regret. Go to somewhere
like [Mastering Emacs](https://masteringemacs.org/reading-guide) for learning
Emacs. Read
spacemacs
[documentation](https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs/blob/master/doc/DOCUMENTATION.org) or
give numerous other
[starter kits](https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/StarterKits) a try. Org mode
also has its [manual](http://orgmode.org/#docs) and after a basic introduction
it keeps getting better with your needs.
