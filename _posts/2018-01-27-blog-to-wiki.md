<p class="post-intro" markdown="1">
Maintaining a blog has certain disadvantages, mostly due to linearity of post
timeline and its apparent permanence. I am making a switch to a wiki which
provides much more freedom and makes the texts and corrections flow much more
fluently.

<span class="dropcap">E</span>ver since I started this blog, every post has made
me rethink the purpose of the whole blog. Sometimes I have been putting personal
experiences, other times half baked opinions. A few times, I have pushed because
there was nothing in here for a long time. Even more than these organizational
issues, the idea of having a _conclusion_, with a timestamp, is something which
keeps the blog from working _along with me_. Not that I have a pandora box to
open, but I do have a bunch of perpetually partially complete pieces scattered
around which don't fit in a blog.

A personal publishing system should work well with my workflow which is
(usually) less driven by deadlines/checkpoints and more on explorations.

# A personal wiki

After some scripting to try and improve the content generation pipeline for this
blog recently, I realized that I probably am recreating everything org-mode
already provides. Even more, I already have a bunch of org files sitting around.

So I am now moving to an org mode based personal wiki. Not very wiki like and
just a pile of files which lives at [/pile](/pile). The `pile` is fundamentally
a place to log things in the process of gathering and playing around with
knowledge of any kind. This makes it more of an assistive tool for myself than
anyone else. Using org mode helps a lot in this _selfish_ endeavor because of
[org-babel](https://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/) (for authoring code
based pages) and [org-publish](https://orgmode.org/manual/Publishing.html) (for
publishing the whole pile to the web). I will most probably have a page
documenting my setup once it reaches a decent level with enough differences from
other org-publish tutorials on the web.

In case you tend to have a bunch of jupyter notebooks with just explorations, [I
highly recommend](/2016/11/02/org-babel/) looking at org-babel.

Here are some of the items that I am thinking of
putting up in my pile:

- Notes from readings.
- Problems I would like to know answers to and incremental solutions as I get
  time to work on those.
- Reading lists and other similar aggregations which are right now floating
  around in separate repositories.
- Some miscellaneous writings.

Some contents still belong in a blog post (and they will come out as and when
needed), but many ideas are fundamentally evolving and they need a lot more than
just a bunch of edits to tell a consistent story.
