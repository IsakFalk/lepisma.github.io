White rhinos are down to a few just because irrational persuasions are
effective. Everywhere. Something that might help? Identifying lies.
</p>
<!--more-->

<p><span class="dropcap">I</span>n case you didn’t know ‘<em>there are only 3 northern
white rhinos left on the planet</em>’. There were 5 since I started counting. One
died
<a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2015/07/29/world/northern-rhino-dies/">earlier this year</a>.
Another one,
<a href="http://www.wired.com/2015/11/death-endangered-rhino-leaves-three-world/">last month</a>.
It’s closer relative, southern white rhino, is relatively safe as of this
writing but you never know. Rhinos are ominously popular targets for poachers.
Along with Bengal Tiger (skin) and Elephant (teeth), this animal (horns) is one
of the first that comes to mind when I hear <em>poaching</em>.</p>

<p>Where exactly do the horns go? Having no direct marketing channel, illegal items
are slightly harder to sell (in the usual sense). Although you can create a
market out of thin air, most of the cases require external factors. How about a
bit of <em>human irrationality</em> ?</p>

<p>One of the reasons why Rhinoceros hunting has recently gathered pace is due to a
weird outburst of horn demands from Vietnam. Apparently, there was a
<a href="http://qz.com/82302/theres-a-country-that-will-pay-300000-per-rhino-horn-to-cure-cancer-and-hangovers-and-its-wiping-out-rhinos/">guy</a>
who was cured from terminal cancer using rhinoceros horns and people weren’t
able to stop the tendency of ‘<em>inferring from a sample size of 1</em>’ to outgrow
their rationality.</p>

<p>This brings up an important issue. Not that other reasons for dwindling wildlife
are not so important, but because <em>this</em> specific reason is prevalent in every
other area to an extent you would probably always underestimate.</p>

<h1 id="quacks-advertisements-and-lies">Quacks, Advertisements and Lies</h1>

<p>Recently, I got home, started watching TV, and one thing i noticed is that <em>our
situation, in India, isn’t drastically different from Vietnam</em>. I have seen
traditional Chinese medicine usually getting the heat for promoting irrational
cultural beliefs (sadly, many involving endangered species). Are we any better?</p>

<p>Natural remedies are inspiring. And to be very clear, I have a space of respect
for them (I mean, why not?). But I never quite understand the <em>point of view</em> of
many of their propagators here. When engaged in discussion, most of them try to
sell one of the following conclusions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Western medicine is trying to destroy our traditional wisdom</li>
  <li>People in ancient times were much healthier</li>
  <li>We have a long history with medicine</li>
</ul>

<p>Honestly, I have stopped paying attention to statements which don’t add anything
in anyone’s plate. So, I ask, tell me what <em>you</em> are proposing? And I get
statements like this (not disclosing the source)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>vegetarian food reduces domestic violence.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now, its not about the people who can <em>cure</em> homosexuality, the one who can tell
we are going to die in future, the one who can guarantee 700% reduction in fat
or the realists with a conservative 100%. It is about how <em>we</em> see these
events and infer. I will be willing to believe the given statement if the person
who is promoting this <em>knowledge</em> can answer following questions affirmatively.</p>

<h1 id="few-simple-questions">Few Simple Questions</h1>

<blockquote>
  <p>At school you were taught about chemicals in test tubes, equations to describe
motion, and maybe something on photosynthesis—about which more later—but in all
likelihood you were taught nothing about death, risk, statistics, and the
science of what will kill or cure you.</p>
  <footer>
    <p>Ben Goldacre - Bad Science (2008)</p>
  </footer>
</blockquote>

<p>Here are a few simple questions (non-exhaustive, please email me to add/remove
things) I believe we should be asking to judge the conclusions of a research.
Since researches on medicine and likes involve comparison and statistical
testings, these are not exactly valid for <em>any</em> research.</p>

<h2 id="1-what-do-the-numbers-mean">1. What do the numbers mean?</h2>

<p>No, not what you are being told. What the numbers <em>actually</em> mean? Here is a
case.</p>

<p>In a test on N (N/2, N/2) people, product A performed 50% better than product
B (assume an effect).</p>

<p>What is <em>50%</em> here?</p>

<ul>
  <li>Is there a performance metric which bumps 50% more for A guys (first N/2, say)
than for B guys (next N/2)?</li>
  <li>Is it a mean (max, median) of that metric for groups?</li>
  <li>Or, is it slightly quirky like “it worked for 50% more guys”?</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="2-can-i-reproduce-the-numbers">2. Can I reproduce the numbers?</h2>

<p>Good research is reproducible research. Given an array of results, access to
research documentations and methodologies, a person should be able to get to the
same conclusions as published.</p>

<p><em>Once done, there is a more critical question. This should be up in the order,
but most of the times Q1 and Q2 hit it right.</em></p>

<h2 id="3-is-the-process-fair">3. Is the process fair?</h2>

<p>Now since the documented methods are providing the expected results, is the
method actually performing a fair test?</p>

<p>For example if you want to compare two toothpastes, you will want to have few
basic things like:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Two <em>randomly</em> divided groups</li>
  <li>Doubly blinded experiment</li>
  <li>No confounding variables etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>Also, is the research using sufficient sample size? Are the numbers compared
properly using established statistical tests? etc.</p>

<hr />

<p>If you see the previous statement (about domestic violence) as a research
outcome (which is the only reason you should be believing it), then you can
immediately identify what might be wrong in the experiment (spoiler:
<em>everything</em>). When you are communicating via a proper scientific channel, you
are automatically bound to go ahead only when the results are conclusive. But
when statements like this start to frame the basis of judgments, you know the
channel of knowledge generation and communication is severely damaged. I have
heard so many people (due to their own personal reasons) around me agreeing on
similar issues like ‘<em>media torturing and twisting facts</em>’. Yet, shockingly
small number of people criticize these incidences of quackery with similar
enthusiasm.</p>

value of your contribution; not just the information that leads to judgment in
one particular direction or another.</p>

<p>Many argue that its important to use dumbed down logic to reach a mass audience.
But, there is a difference between <em>dumbed down</em> and <em>simplified</em>. One misleads
people in thinking <em>they know the actual thing</em> while the other make them
realize <em>what they don’t know</em>.</p>

<p>The major problems with the propagators are probably not the numerous questions
raised, but the ones unanswered because their claims are <em>unfalsifiable</em>. This
approach is not a sane way to do any Science. Most of the claimed success is due
to the confounding variables covering the obvious observations like <em>eating
healthy helps</em>. Others left are weeded out in a huge placebo storm.</p>

<p>Many a times, you <em>can’t avoid</em> irrationality. But, sometimes you <em>can’t
afford</em>. There is a huge responsibility on you when you are touching dead
serious topics involving lives, deaths and crowd emotions. We can’t afford
statements like <em>“AIDS can be cured through yoga”</em>, but while we can, lets ask
if these statements have enough evidences to answer the questions.</p>

<hr />

<p>Before finishing, I would strongly recommend reading
<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3272165-bad-science">Bad Science</a> by Ben
Goldacre (the quotes in this post are directly taken from there), specially the
chapter ‘<em>The Doctor Will Sue You Now</em>’ if you are on a tight schedule. The
story in the chapter explains the exact conundrum here with amazing precision
and is downright serious.</p>

<p>I wrote this post because of the following few reasons, none of which involve
initiating a <em>hate debate</em> against any of the specific ideas mentioned.</p>

<ul>
  <li>I felt like I should.</li>
  <li>I still see many of my friends, relatives and myself reacting to senseless
persuasions. So at its worst, this post can simply work as a sanity reminder
for me.</li>
  <li>Maybe I am just ashamed of what our species has done to rhinos.</li>
</ul>

<p>And sadly, the rhinoceros count is not the only thing thats going down.</p>
