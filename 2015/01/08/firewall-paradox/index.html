<article class="post-content">
  <p><span class="dropcap">I</span>t’s been another year in the life of our fellow
human, Stephen Hawking and I was just revisiting his idea about the infamous
Firewall paradox. Hawking is one of the few to actually popularize Black Holes
among masses, so his <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1401.5761v1.pdf">paper</a> declaring
<em>theoretical impossibility</em> of black holes was an obvious rager.</p>

<p>Going back gives us the root problem about black holes. And it is a very basic
one. The <em>Black hole Information Paradox</em>, defying the second law of
thermodynamics.</p>

<p>The second law is about entropy, or rather <em>information</em>. The law hinders
decrease in information content of the universe. This is what gives time, an
arrow. This is what creates now, and tomorrow. One of the most beautiful, but
also one of the most controversial thing. It comes in question every time
quantum mechanics and general relativity have a playoff.</p>

<h2 id="the-firewall">The Firewall</h2>

<p>Black hole firewall is a recent thing (2012-13). <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1207.3123v4.pdf">Read
here</a>. According to <em>Hawking process</em>,
black holes radiate and evaporate as a result of quantum fluctuation, which is a
well established fact now in modern Physics.</p>

<aside>
  <p>If you don’t have much motivation to read the paper, here
it is. Firewalls are one of the coolest way of winning over the debate about the
entry of Cooper in the black hole in the recent movie
<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0816692/">Interstellar</a> (if you are having any).</p>
</aside>

</figure>

<p>But, here is the thing, if, accidentally, your water bottle gets sucked in a
black hole, and if the black hole evaporates after few years, you loose
information! This is the information paradox. The violation of the second law.
Many believe its okay to have this loss. But, an interesting solution came when
information was supposed to escape from black holes. <em>Firewall</em>.</p>

<p>Firewalls are literal <em>firewalls</em> of energy on the surface of black holes. This
happens due to the breaking of entanglement of particles in black hole
evaporation process. This is similar to breaking of chemical bonds. So, this
gives an alternate ending to Interstellar, where Cooper dies abruptly and
<em>foolishly</em>. But this isn’t fun.</p>

</figure>

<p>Firewall plays with general relativity on the other side and again, this raises
questions on the second law.</p>

<p>Hawking, in 2014, proposed an <em>Apparent</em> horizon rather than the hyped,
<em>Event</em> horizon. The event horizon is what makes black holes what they are in
popular literature. An apparent horizon doesn’t take the incoming stuff to
singularity, it returns things back, busting the whole black business.</p>

<p>Whatever happens, it’s really amusing to see what are the implications if the
second law is flawed, or it is not what we think it is.</p>

<h2 id="the-second-law">The Second Law</h2>

<p>I personally feel, the second law of thermodynamics is highly underrated in
engineering institutions (in India at least). People take away the beauty of it
by associating it only with engines and refrigerators. It is much (much!) more
than that, it is the theory of information, about what has happened and what can
happen. Prick it, and the whole Universe’s history will change.</p>

<p>The second law governs what will happen and thus gives a direction for movement
in the time dimension. Assuming <em>now</em> is only a construct of human brain which
itself is due to the second law, it is fascinating to look at the true nature of
time. Is there an inverse which leads to undoing things, unrolling the usual?
Is it possible that time is and always was a two way street?</p>

<p><em>Time</em> is exciting! Especially <em>right now</em>, when there are questions raised
on the second law, and <em>time</em> itself is feeling elusive (no pun intended).</p>

<p><em>Does the entropy always increase ? Or is it just a convex function of time?</em></p>

<p>I hope, we will learn the answers someday, or maybe we already have.</p>
