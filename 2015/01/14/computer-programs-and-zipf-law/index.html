Exploration of software projects with large code base looking at keyword
frequency distributions. Surprisingly (or not so surprisingly) they roughly
follow the famous Zipfian distribution.
</p>
<!--more-->

<p><span class="dropcap">I</span> was reading a book on genomics named
<em><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13521382-the-violinist-s-thumb">The Violinist’s Thumb</a></em>
when I got the idea behind this post. The basic idea of the book is <em>how our
lives are written by our genetic code</em>. Along with the <em>connectome</em>, I believe
the idea defines the whole life of an individual.</p>

<p>Meanwhile in the reading, the book showed me a beautiful empirical law. The
<em>Zipf’s law</em>. When George Kingsley Zipf was playing with classic literary
works, he discovered a pattern in the frequency distribution of words.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The <em>second</em> most used word has <em>half</em> the frequency as compared to first
most frequent word.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <em>third</em> most used word has <em>one third</em> the frequency as compared to
the first most frequent word and so on. . .</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>This is Zipf’s law. Now the amazing bit. Since then, the Zipfian (the frequency
distribution following Zipf’s law) distribution has been seen in music,
<a href="http://io9.com/the-mysterious-law-that-governs-the-size-of-your-city-1479244159">city population</a>,
mass extinctions, earthquakes and even DNA.</p>

<p>Originally, the explanation Zipf gave for the phenomenon was the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_effort">Principle of least effort</a>.
According to Zipf, the principle governs the transfer of information via the
path of least effort and this explains the relation between <em>variations</em> and
<em>repetitions</em>.</p>

<p>Seeing such a pattern in human languages led me to search if this works for
computer languages. Although I didn’t expect anything, since the structure of
human and computer languages aren’t exactly same, but I gave it a try. Similar
to words in human language, I took <em>keywords</em> in computer languages, since
variable names and other things aren’t as frequent as keywords. Saying that, I
do realize that this is not exactly the way this should be done, but it should
work as a crude approximation.</p>

<h1 id="results">Results</h1>

<p>Below are the plots of keyword frequencies (few top keywords) for various
software projects along with the approx Zipfian distribution. The projects here
are dominated by (almost) one single language and are large projects as far as
lines of code are considered, this <em>might</em> be better for finding such patterns.</p>

    <p><strong>Linux Kernel</strong>: The language of the project is predominantly C. I ran the
frequency analysis for C/C++ language keywords.</p>

    <p><strong>Free BSD</strong>: The language again is mostly C/C++, did the same analysis here.</p>

<p>Ah! I don’t know if I can declare this, but the distributions look nice. The law
of least effort or anything else. Although there is high probability that these
are not representatives of Zipf’s law, but nevertheless, its fun to see
something like this.</p>

<aside>
  <p>The script is <a href="https://github.com/lepisma/zipf">here</a> and is just a
kind-of-works thing. A more rigorous analysis can be done, since the script
neglected many things.</p>
</aside>

<p>There are many power laws in nature that tend to line up observations in a
specific order. Individually, things don’t show up, but on a <em>crowdish</em> scale,
the patterns begin to emerge, consider population, species, social networks,
crowd behavior, star clusters, sub atomic particles . . . everywhere.</p>

<p>This feels like toy mathematics, like knot theory, but there are serious
implications, and there maybe more. Here is an excerpt from the Wikipedia
article on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_tail">long tail</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In his Wired article, Chris Anderson cites earlier research [17] by Erik
Brynjolfsson, Yu (Jeffrey) Hu, and Michael D. Smith, who first used a log-linear
curve on an XY graph to describe the relationship between Amazon.com sales and
sales ranking. They found that a large proportion of Amazon.com’s book sales
come from obscure books that were not available in brick-and-mortar stores. They
then quantified the potential value of the long tail to consumers. In an article
published in 2003, these authors showed that, while most of the discussion about
the value of the Internet to consumers has revolved around lower prices,
consumer benefit (a.k.a. consumer surplus) from access to increased product
variety in online book stores is ten times larger than their benefit from access
to lower prices online. Thus, the primary value of the internet to consumers
comes from releasing new sources of value by providing access to products in the
long tail.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Anyway, the exciting thing about living in current time is that we have data.
Much more than what Zipf had.</p>
