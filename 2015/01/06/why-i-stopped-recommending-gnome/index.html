Approachability and potential of customization are important parts of a user
interface. GNOME feels weaker now in this department as compared to other
desktop environments.
</p>
<!--more-->

<p><span class="dropcap">F</span>edora (12 I guess) was my first Linux distro. I
didn’t use Linux based stuff much back then but the change from the Luna theme
of XP to GNOME 2 felt nice.</p>

<p>When they released lovelock (F15), they added GNOME 3. And needless to say, it
was pure eye candy. Personally, I find the grid (of icons) based menu much
easier to scan with my eyes and so I loved GNOME 3.</p>

<p>In spite of what popular opinions say about GNOME 3, I believe, drastic changes
in UI help frame the next generation of design process. It has happened with
Windows 7 (with Vista’s aero theme) and <em>hopefully</em> will happen with Windows 10
(8’s metro stuff).</p>

<hr />

<p>After few years, I got inclined to use Linux as my full time OS, and then it all
began, starting from Ubuntu.</p>

<p>Whenever I try to make my thoughts flexible about things like <em>respecting others
opinion</em>, first thing I say to myself is “<em>Ubuntu is also good, don’t make a
biased opinion</em>”.</p>

<p>But I never got over it. Ubuntu has never worked on my machine for more than ~15
days (even Arch was stabler). So, I never got my hands on unity much. Then came
Mint, but you can’t just get off your genes, and crash cycles again set in.
After this I just kept hopping over and over,</p>

<ul>
  <li>Fedora</li>
  <li>Arch</li>
  <li>FreeBSD (yes!)</li>
  <li>DragonFlyBSD</li>
  <li>Sabayon</li>
  <li>Manjaro</li>
  <li>. . .</li>
  <li>Random OS#n.</li>
</ul>

<p>In those days, there was hardly an OS in top 20 on
<a href="http://www.distrowatch.com">Distrowatch</a> that I hadn’t used. I knew there were
solutions to the crashes, but it was fun. I got to use a lot of OSes. Once I
thought to use Gentoo, (for those who don’t know, the whole OS gets compiled on
your system and some say that compiling libreOffice itself can take days,
although portage does provide binaries) but gave up on the idea.</p>

<p>The sweetest distro experience I have so far is with OpenSUSE and I use the KDE
version. KDE feels intelligent. Even though the UI basically is the same old
cliché : taskbar + startmenu, it is open to changes and accepts them with
dignity. Ironically, I hate few of the trademarks of KDE’s tradition</p>

<ul>
  <li>the inconsistent visual styles for GTK applications</li>
  <li>the default oxygen theme</li>
  <li>dolphin</li>
</ul>

<p>But you can’t complain. <em>You can change all that</em>. GNOME also has quite a good
amount of tricks under its sleeves, like the shell extensions and the tweak
tool. But after fiddling for few days, things fade away. Obviously the whole
code is available for you to modify, but its about what is in <em>your hand</em>,
especially when you are not exactly a developer, but one who uses software to
solve something other than software itself.</p>

<p>When I upgraded to plasma 5, there were glitches in redrawing the frames on
mouse hover. Without googling anything, I went to KDE settings and found a quick
fix at just 3-4 clicks distance, I switched from OpenGl to XRender. Things like
this are breeze to do in KDE.</p>

<p>Yesterday, I had to switch OS for something and went for Fedora 21 with GNOME. I
faced GNOME after at least a year. Surprisingly, the same redraw glitch
appeared. I again went for display related settings, but here there were only
crude things, wallpapers, colors etc.</p>

<figure><img class="zoomTarget" data-closeclick="true" src="/images/posts/gnome/gnome.png" /><figcaption>

<p>Even though the first face of settings is comparable to KDE’s but the <em>depth</em>
is where the difference lies.</p>

<p>The ease of modification in KDE (and even Xfce for that matter) is a whole level
ahead of GNOME. You might want this or might not, but face it, in a Linux based
OS, having more control never hurts. It actually opens way to troubleshooting
lots and lots of issues which keep popping up every now and then.</p>

<p>I still feel the fault in design of GNOME is not that they dared to experiment
while releasing v3, they simply kept oversimplifying stuff while the control
kept lagging behind till the point the users don’t feel they have it. Ardent
open source fans might hate this, but <em>Windows 8’s approach felt much better to
me</em>.</p>

<hr />

<p>There is an art in throwing every possible customization option without scaring
the user away. The law of <em>sensible defaults</em>. Windows has been doing this
exceptionally beautifully. KDE and Xfce do this equally well.</p>

<p>Its easy to make a command line interface, the symbol of heavy customization
potential. Equally easy is to go the other side and make a simple and <em>clean</em>
interface with <em>big buttons</em>. But only a few realize that there is <em>not</em> a
trade-off here (at least not as much as people think of). Being a huge fan of
its UI, I wish GNOME will get over this someday.</p>
